# Event-Management-System

 Introducing our Event Management System, designed to streamline campus event planning, registration, and ticket booking. I am developing the system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), and we are utilizing the agile Scrum methodology for efficient development.

- Schedule a Event.
- View upcoming events.

- Getting approval for the events.
